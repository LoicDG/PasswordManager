TODO to finish
  -Do GUI
  -Add password hiding + show button
  -Learn and (if needed) modify the connection to DB, is it good if the conn is kept open when the app runs
    or is it better if we close it and only open it when a query is made
TODO to expand (not in a particular order)
  -Set up a server
  -Add password recovery
  -Make it into an actual app (not a batch file)
  -Android application? ðŸ‘€
